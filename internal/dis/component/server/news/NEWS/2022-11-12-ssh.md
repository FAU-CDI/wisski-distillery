title: Refactored SSH Support
date: 2022-11-12
---

- Fully refactored ssh for users to use a real OpenSSH Server along with a small custom proxy in between
- It is now possible for developers to directly use e.g. [VSCode Remote SSH](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/ssh) to develop new WissKI features directly on the distillery.
- No configuration beyond regular ssh access is neccessary
