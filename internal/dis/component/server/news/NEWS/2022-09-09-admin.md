title: Addition of an administrative server
date: 2022-09-09
---

- We have added a new web route under `/dis/`
- Allows administrators to manage WissKI Instances and see their status
- Administrators can e.g. download pathbuilders and make backups and snapshots
- At this point it is only for administrators
- A future (public) server with statistics will follow
