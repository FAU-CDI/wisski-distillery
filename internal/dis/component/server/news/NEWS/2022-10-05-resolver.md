title: Addition of a Global Distillery Resolver
date: 2022-10-05

- We have added a global WissKI Resolver, that functions similarly to the WissKI resolver under `/wisski/`.
- It can resolve WissKI URIs for the entire distillery, and redirect to their view page.
- Can be called exactly like the `/wisski/get?uri=` route of individual WissKIs, but toplevel on the distillery.
